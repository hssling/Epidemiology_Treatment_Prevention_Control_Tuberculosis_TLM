## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacteria. It primarily affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can involve other organs (extrapulmonary TB). TB is preventable and curable but remains a major global health challenge.

### Key Facts:
- Caused by acid-fast bacilli (AFB)
- Affects approximately 10 million people globally each year
- Leading infectious killer after COVID-19

---

## Epidemiology

### Global Burden
- **Incidence**: 10 million new TB cases annually
- **Deaths**: 1.5 million TB-related deaths per year
- **Status**: Top infectious disease killer worldwide
- **Contribution**: Major contributor to antimicrobial resistance (AMR)

### High-Burden Countries
TB is concentrated in 30 countries, with over 87% of cases occurring in these countries:
- Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa (highest burden)

### India Statistics
- India accounts for ~27% of global TB burden
- Annual incidence: 270 per 100,000 population
- Prevalence: ~192 per 100,000
- Mortality: 23 per 100,000 (2019 estimates)

### Latent TB Infection (LTBI)
- About 25% of the world's population has LTBI
- Lifetime risk of developing active TB: 5-15%

## Transmission and Pathogenesis

### Transmission
TB is transmitted through the air when a person with active pulmonary TB:

- Coughs
- Sneezes
- Speaks loudly
- Sings

The infectious unit is the droplet nucleus (1-5 microns), which can remain airborne for hours and travel far.

### Risk of Infection
The risk depends on:
- Concentration of infectious droplet nuclei
- Duration of exposure
- Virulence of the organism
- Susceptibility of the host

### Pathogenesis
1. **Primary Infection**: Inhalation → deposition in alveoli → phagocytosis by macrophages
2. **Latent TB**: Bacteria survive but are contained by host immunity
3. **Reactivation**: When immunity declines, bacteria multiply and cause active disease
4. **Progressive Primary TB**: Rapid progression (common in infants, immunocompromised)

In active TB, there is tissue destruction, caseation necrosis, cavitation, and spread through blood/lymphatics.

## Risk Factors

### Host Factors
- **HIV/AIDS**: Increases risk of TB disease progression by 20-30 fold
- **Malnutrition/Underweight**: Weakens immunity
- **Diabetes mellitus**: 2-3 fold increased risk
- **Tobacco use and smoking**: Significantly increases TB risk
- **Alcohol use disorder**: Increases susceptibility
- **Chronic kidney disease, malignancy, silicosis**

### Social and Environmental Factors
- Overcrowding and poor ventilation
- Poverty and homelessness
- Occupational exposure (healthcare workers, miners)
- Migration and imprisonment

### Special Groups at High Risk
- Infants and elderly
- People living with HIV (PLHIV)
- Healthcare workers
- Close contacts of active TB cases

- Night sweats
- Fatigue and weakness
- Anorexia and weight loss
- Pallor

**Pulmonary symptoms**:
- Cough (persistent >2 weeks)
- Hemoptysis
- Chest pain (pleuritic)
- Dyspnea

### Extrapulmonary TB (15% of cases)

## Diagnosis

### Step 1: Clinical Suspicion
- Persistent cough >2 weeks
- Unexplained weight loss
- Fever >2 weeks
- Night sweats

### Basic Investigations
- Chest X-ray: Infiltrates, cavitation, fibrosis
- Sputum examination: Obligatory in suspected pulmonary TB
- Tuberculin Skin Test (TST): Mantoux test
- Blood tests: CBC, ESR, liver/renal function

### Microbiological Diagnosis
- **Smear microscopy**: Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Acid-fast bacilli (AFB)
  - Sensitivity: 50-80%, Specificity: High
- **Molecular tests**: CBNAAT (GeneXpert)
  - Rapid, detects MTB and rifampicin resistance
  - Sensitivity: 90%, Specificity: 99%
- **Culture**: Gold standard
  - Solid (Löwenstein-Jensen) or liquid media
  - Takes 4-6 weeks, allows drug susceptibility testing
- **NAAT**: Nucleic acid amplification tests

### Diagnostic Algorithms
WHO recommends COPD approach (Cellular, Obstructive, Pulmonary Defect) for TB?

No, that's COPD. For TB:
- In high-prevalence settings: Use CBNAAT as initial test
- In low-prevalence: Start with smear microscopy

### Special Considerations
- HIV-positive patients may have atypical presentations
- Pediatric TB: More likely extrapulmonary, difficult to diagnose
- LTBI: Asymptomatic, TST >10mm or IGRA positive

## Treatment

### Principles of Treatment
- Early treatment prevents spread
- Supervised treatment (DOTS) to ensure compliance
- Combination therapy to prevent resistance
- Monitor for side effects and response

### Drug-Susceptible TB (DS-TB)
**Regimen**: 2HRZE/4HR (WHO 2010 guidelines, still used in many places)
- **Intensive Phase (2 months)**: Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (Z), Ethambutol (E)
- **Continuation Phase (4 months)**: Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R)
- **Total duration**: 6 months

**Newer regimens** (shorter):
- 3RP (for tolerant DS-TB): Rifapentine, Rifampicin, Moxifloxacin (for 3 months)

**Response monitoring**:
- Clinical improvement: Fever subsides, cough decreases
- Sputum conversion: Negative smear by 2 months
- Chest X-ray improvement

### Drug-Resistant TB (DR-TB)
- **Multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB)**: Resistant to INH and rifampicin
  - Intensive phase: 5-7 drugs including injectables (kanamycin/strptomycin)
  - Duration: 18-24 months
  - Cure rate: ~70%

- **Extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB)**: MDR + resistance to fluoroquinolones + injectables
  - 20-30 drugs regimen, >20 months duration
  - Cure rate: <50%

**New drugs for DR-TB**:
- Bedaquiline
- Delamanid
- Linezolid

### Treatment Monitoring and Side Effects
- **Hepatitis**: INH most hepatotoxic, monitor LFTs
- **Neuropathy**: Peripheral neuropathy (INH, ethambutol) → give pyridoxine
- **Ototoxicity**: Injectables → monitor hearing
- **Skin reactions, GI upset, arthralgia**

### Special Situations
- **TB-HIV co-infection**: Start ART after 2-8 weeks of ATT (depending on CD4 count)
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid streptomycin, control hypoglycemia
- **Children**: Use pediatric formulation, weight-based dosing
- **Contacts**: Chemoprophylaxis with 6H or 3HP

## Chapter 8: TB in Special Populations

### Pediatric TB
- **Epidemiology**: 1.2 million children develop TB annually (11% of total cases)
- **Clinical Features**: Often extrapulmonary (30-50% vs 15% in adults), lymph node TB most common
- **Diagnosis Challenges**: Difficult sputum collection, anatomical differences, paradoxical reactions
- **Treatment**: Shorter regimens possible, weight-based dosing, prophylactic pyridoxine
- **Prevention**: BCG vaccine effective in children, maternal screening important

### TB in Pregnancy
- **Risk**: TB increases maternal/fetal mortality
- **Clinical**: Similar presentation, but often confused with pregnancy symptoms
- **Diagnosis**: Chest X-ray safe during pregnancy, consider pregnancy-specific algorithms
- **Treatment**: Avoid streptomycin (embryotoxic), INH/pyrazinamide/ rifampicin/ethambutol safe
- **Outcomes**: Successful delivery possible with proper management

### TB-HIV Co-infection
- **Epidemiology**: TB causes 25% of HIV deaths, HIV increases TB risk 20-30 fold
- **Clinical**: Atypical presentations, extrapulmonary common, faster progression
- **Management**: ART initiation 2-8 weeks post-ATT depending on CD4 count
- **Challenges**: Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), drug interactions
- **Prevention**: Early ART crucial, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis

### TB in Diabetes Mellitus
- **Risk**: Diabetics 2-3 times more likely to develop TB
- **Mechanisms**: Impaired immune response, poor glycemic control, associated malnutrition
- **Treatment Modification**: Avoid thiazolidinediones interactions, monitor for hypoglycemia
- **Prevention**: Good glycemic control, regular TB screening in diabetics

### TB in Healthcare Workers
- **Risk**: 2-5 times higher risk than general population
- **Exposure**: Close patient contact, crowded wards, inadequate ventilation
- **Prevention**: Annual screening, fit-tested N95 masks, proper ventilation systems
- **Post-Exposure Management**: Testing, prophylactic treatment if indicated
