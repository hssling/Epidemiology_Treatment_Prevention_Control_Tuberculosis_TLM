## Introduction to TB in Special Populations

Special populations face unique challenges in TB prevention, diagnosis, and treatment due to immunological, physiological, or environmental factors. Understanding these differences is crucial for optimal patient outcomes.

---

## Pediatric Tuberculosis

Children represent a vulnerable group with distinct clinical features and diagnostic challenges.

### Epidemiology
- **Global Burden**: ~1.2 million children develop TB annually (11% of all cases)
- **Age Distribution**: Highest incidence in children <5 years
- **Transmission**: Usually from adult household contacts
- **India Context**: ~200,000 childhood TB cases annually

### Clinical Features
- **Pulmonary TB**: Primary complex (Ghon focus + hilar adenopathy)
- **Extrapulmonary TB**: More common (30-50% vs 15% adults)
- **Severe Forms**: Miliary TB, TB meningitis more frequent
- **Symptoms**: Often non-specific (failure to thrive, fever)

### Diagnosis Challenges
- **Sample Collection**: Difficult sputum collection, use alternatives (gastric aspirates, stool)
- **Immunologic Response**: Younger children show poor TST response
- **Radiologic Findings**: Hilar adenopathy prominent, normal CXR common

### Treatment
- **Regimen**: Same as adults, weight-based dosing
- **Formulations**: Child-friendly or crushable tablets
- **Adherence**: Family-centered support
- **Monitoring**: Growth parameters, vitamin supplementation

## TB in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Pregnancy impacts TB, and TB affects pregnancy outcomes, requiring careful management decisions.

### Epidemiology and Risk
- **Incidence**: Similar to non-pregnant women
- **Maternal Complications**: Increased mortality, preterm delivery
- **Fetal Effects**: Low birth weight, congenital infection rare
- **Transmission**: Increased risk to infant in first year

### Clinical Features
- **Symptoms**: Often vague, confused with pregnancy (fatigue, dyspnea)
- **Forms**: Similar to general population
- **Progression**: May accelerate post-delivery

### Diagnosis
- **X-ray Caution**: Abdominal shielding, minimize radiation
- **Safety**: CXR safe (fetal dose <0.01 Gy, minimal risk)
- **Alternatives**: Clinical diagnosis if suspicion high
- **Ultrasound**: Safe for evaluating pleural/peritoneal TB

### Treatment
- **Safe Drugs**: Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol
- **Five to Avoid**: Streptomycin (ototoxic to fetus)
- **Pregnancy Category**: Pyrazinamide (category C)
- **Therapy Initiation**: Can start ATT anytime, defer if possible to second trimester
- **Post-Delivery**: Neonates receive BCG, monitored for TB

### Breastfeeding
- **Safety**: ATT in breast milk minimal, infant can breastfeed
- **Infant Prophylaxis**: Pyridoxine 10mg daily if maternal INH
- **Congenital TB**: Rare, but requires exclusion

## TB-HIV Co-infection

The deadly synergism between HIV and TB makes this the highest-risk population.

### Epidemiology
- **Risk**: HIV-infected persons 20-30x more likely to develop TB
- **Etiology**: TB causes 25% of HIV deaths
- **Regional Variation**: Highest in sub-Saharan Africa (co-infection rates >50%)
- **CD4 Correlation**: Higher incidence with CD4 <200 cells/µL

### Pathogenesis
- **Immunodeficiency**: CD4 depletion impairs granuloma formation
- **Presentation**: Atypical features, extrapulmonary more common
- **Reactivation**: Rapid progression from latent to active disease
- **Transmission**: Increased infectiousness in HIV-TB co-infection

### Clinical Features
- **Atypical Presentation**: Normal CXR, disseminated disease
- **Extrapulmonary Sites**: Lymph nodes, disseminated, pleural common
- **Opportunistic Infections**: Often concurrent infections
- **Immune Reconstitution**: IRIS (Paradoxical worsening after ART)

### Diagnosis
- **Sensitivity Issues**: Smear microscopy <50% sensitive (vs 60-80% HIV-negative)
- **CB-NAAT Superior**: Better sensitivity in HIV-positive persons
- **Drug Interaction**: Rifampicin decreases anti-retroviral drug levels
- **Ultrasound Guidance**: For lymph node sampling

### Treatment
- **Timing**: ART initiation 2-8 weeks after ATT start
- **Drug Combinations**: Avoid nevirapine with rifampicin
- **IRIS Management**: Corticosteroids, manage symptoms
- **Prophylaxis**: Cotrimoxazole decreases mortality

### ART-TB Integration
- **TEN/TFP**: Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Efavirenz (preferred with rifampicin)
- **Monitoring**: Viral load suppression, CD4 recovery
- **Adherence Support**: Integrated DOT and ART counseling

## TB in Diabetes Mellitus

Diabetes mellitus significantly increases TB susceptibility and complicates management.

### Epidemiology
- **Relative Risk**: 2-3 fold increased TB incidence
- **Mechanism**: Impaired phagocytosis, cytokine dysfunction
- **Global Context**: 463 million diabetics, major TB risk factor
- **India**: 77 million diabetics, substantial TB burden

### Pathophysiology
- **Immunologic Impairment**: Reduced T-cell function, poor granuloma formation
- **Glycemic Control**: Hyperglycemia promotes bacterial growth
- **Complications**: Increased cavitary disease, delayed healing

### Clinical Features
- **Diagnosis Delay**: Atypical presentations confuse symptoms
- **Disease Severity**: More extensive pulmonary involvement
- **Treatment Response**: Slower sputum conversion, higher failure rates
- **Recurrence**: Higher post-treatment recurrence

### Management
- **Glycemic Control**: Intensive management during TB treatment
- **Drug Interactions**: Rifampicin decreases metformin levels
- **Monitoring**: Adverse effects of hyperglycemia
- **Prophylaxis**: Consider TPT in diabetics with LTBI

---

## Occupational TB Risk

Healthcare workers face elevated TB exposure due to patient contact.

### Epidemiology
- **Relative Risk**: 2-5 fold higher than general population
- **High-Risk Activities**: Bronchoscopy, AICU duties
- **Protective Measures**: Vaccination, PPE, routine screening

### Prevention
- **BCG Vaccination**: At birth or pre-employment
- **Fit-Tested Masks**: Annual N95 or PAPR testing
- **Ventilation**: Negative pressure rooms, HEPA filters
- **Annual Screening**: CXR and symptom assessment

### Post-Exposure Management
- **Contact Tracing**: Identify exposed personnel
- **Baseline Testing**: TST or IGRA before exposure
- **Prophylaxis**: Consider TPT if indicated

## TB in Elderly Populations

Aging impacts TB presentation and management in distinct ways.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors
- **Age >65**: Increased reactivation risk
- **Co-morbidities**: Diabetes, malignancy, steroids
- **Presentation**: Atypical, extrapulmonary forms
- **Diagnosis Delay**: Symptoms attributed to age-related issues

### Clinical Features
- **Anatomical Location**: Upper lobe predominance
- **Severity**: Cavitary disease, hemoptysis
- **Drug Metabolism**: Altered pharmacokinetics
- **Superimposed Infections**: Bacterial pneumonia common

### Management Challenges
- **Drug Dosing**: Adjust for renal/hepatic function
- **Adherence**: Polypharmacy issues
- **Complications**: Drug toxicities higher
- **Mental Health**: Depression, isolation

---

## TB in Migrant and Refugee Populations

Migration amplifies TB risk due to socio-economic factors.

### Epidemiology
- **Prevalence**: Higher in cross-border migrants
- **Transmission Risk**: Overcrowded living conditions
- **Screening**: Mandatory for visa applications
- **Stigma**: Fear of deportation affects care-seeking

### Management Issues
- **Access Barriers**: Language, documentation
- **Follow-Up**: Irregular due to mobility
- **Multidrug Resistance**: Higher prevalence in some regions
- **Social Support**: Community health workers

## TB in Patients with Co-existing Conditions

### Timing of ART and ATT in TB-HIV
- **CD4 >50 cells/µL**: Start ART 2 weeks after ATT
- **CD4 <50 cells/µL**: Start ART within 8 weeks (congenital/extra meningeal)
- **Charge Effects**: Rifampicin decreases ARV drug levels
- **Monitoring**: Viral load, CD4 count, adverse reactions

### Pregnancy with Disease Complications
- **Fetal Monitoring**: Regular ultrasound for growth
- **Birth Plan**: Cesarean delivery not required
- **Breastfeeding**: Safe with maternal ATT
- **Postpartum**: Monitor for TB reactivation

### PediatricHIV Integration
- **ART Selection**: Efavirenz-based less hepatotoxic
- **Drug Formulation**: Syrup preparations for children
- **Vaccination**: Live vaccines contraindicated in symptomatic HIV
- **Growth Monitoring**: Adequate nutrition crucial

## Key Points for Review

1. **Pediatric TB**: Primary complex, difficult diagnosis, extensive workup needed
2. **Pregnancy TB**: Streptomycin contraindicated, safe imaging protocols
3. **TB-HIV**: Early ART initiation, IRIS risk high
4. **Diabetes TB**: Glycemic control crucial, consider TPT
5. **Healthcare Workers**: BCG protection, infection control essentials
6. **Elderly TB**: Atypical presentation, PK adjustments
7. **Special Groups**: Modified regimens, enhanced monitoring required
