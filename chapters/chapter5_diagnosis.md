## Introduction to TB Diagnosis

Accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis requires a combination of clinical evaluation, radiological findings, and confirmatory microbiological tests. The diagnostic process involves clinical suspicion followed by systematic investigation and confirmatory testing.

### Diagnostic Challenges
- **Spectrum of Disease**: From asymptomatic latent infection to severe disseminated disease
- **Variable Presentations**: Pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and miliary forms
- **Sample Collection**: Technical difficulties in obtaining adequate samples
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited access to advanced diagnostics in many settings

## Step-wise Approach to TB Diagnosis

### Step 1: Clinical Suspicion
TB diagnosis begins with identifying characteristic clinical symptoms and risk factors that suggest active TB disease.

#### Key Symptoms (TB Symptom Screen)
- **Persistent Cough**: >2 weeks duration (hallmark symptom)
- **Unexplained Weight Loss**: >5% loss in 1-3 months
- **Evening/ Night Fever**: Documented low-grade fever
- **Night Sweats**: Nocturnal sweating severe enough to soak sheets

#### Risk Factors for Suspicion
- **Close Contact**: With known TB patient
- **HIV Infection**: Highest risk group
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, malignancy
- **Demographic Factors**: Immigration from high-burden countries

#### Symptom Screening Score
Technical Notes: Four-symptom screen used in WHO algorithms:
- Presence of cough (>2 weeks) OR
- Fever OR weight loss OR night sweats
- Positive screen triggers further investigation

### Step 2: Basic Investigations

#### Chest X-Ray (CXR)
- **Primary Imaging Tool**: First-line investigation for suspected pulmonary TB
- **Classic Findings**: Upper lobe infiltrates, cavitation, fibrosis
- **Additional Signs**: Hilar lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, miliary pattern
- **Normal CXR**: Occurs in 10-15% of culture-positive TB
- **Limitations**: Poor specificity, radiation exposure concerns

#### Blood Tests
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: Anemia, leukocytosis/leukopenia
- **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**: Elevated in active TB
- **Liver Function Tests (LFT)**: Baseline before starting ATT
- **Kidney Function Tests**: Creatinine clearance for drug dosing

#### Sputum Examination
- **Obligatory for Pulmonary TB**: Collect 2-3 sputum samples
- **Collection Method**: Early morning, deep cough, adequate volume
- **Rejection Criteria**: Saliva samples, inadequate volume (<5ml)

### Step 3: Microbiological Confirmation

#### Direct Smear Microscopy
- **Method**: Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB)
- **Sensitivity**: 45-65% (higher in cavitary TB), specificity high (>95%)
- **Reporting**: + (1-9 AFB/100 fields), ++ (10-99), +++ (1-10/field), ++++ (10+/field)
- **Time**: Results available within 2 hours
- **Limitations**: Low sensitivity, no species identification

#### Enhanced Smear Techniques
- **Fluorochrome Staining**: Auramine-rhodamine stain with fluorescence microscopy
- **Sensitivity**: 20% higher than ZN stain
- **Advantages**: Faster reading, better ergonomics

### Step 4: Advanced Diagnostic Tests

#### Molecular Tests

**Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CB-NAAT/GeneXpert)**
- **Principles**: Real-time PCR amplification and detection
- **Detection**: Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance
- **Sensitivity**: 65-80% in smear-negative TB, 96-99% in smear-positive
- **Specificity**: >99%
- **Time to Results**: <2 hours
- **Advantages**: Same-day diagnosis, drug resistance detection
- **True Sample**: Molecular detection of TB (Trace-Thou No #TB)
- **MTB Detected**: Moderate to high positive

**Truenat MTB Test**
- **Platform**: Portable, battery-operated molecular test
- **Sensitivity**: 90% (comparable to GeneXpert)
- **Applications**: Field use, resource-limited settings
- **Results**: Semi-quantitative (low, medium, high)

#### Line Probe Assay (LPA)
- **Types**: First-line LPA (rifampicin, isoniazid), second-line LPA (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides)
- **Sensitivity/Specificity**: >95%
- **Applications**: Drug resistance testing in MDR-TB patients

#### Culture Methods
- **Gold Standard**: Definitive diagnosis and drug susceptibility testing (DST)
- **Solid Media**: Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium, takes 4-8 weeks
- **Liquid Media**: Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT), faster (1-3 weeks)
- **Molecular Culture**: Identification via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI-TOF)
- **Turnaround Time**: 1-8 weeks depending on method

#### Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRA)
- **Tests Available**: QuantiFERON-TB Gold, T-SPOT.TB
- **Indication**: Latent TB infection (LTBI) diagnosis
- **Advantages**: Single blood draw, not affected by BCG vaccination
- **Limitations**: Expensive, requires laboratory infrastructure
- **Time to Results**: 24-48 hours

#### Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)
- **Method**: Intradermal injection of purified protein derivative (PPD)
- **Reading**: 48-72 hours after injection, transverse induration
- **Positive Cut-off**: ≥10 mm for immunocompetent, ≥5 mm for immunosuppressed
- **Limitations**: False positives with BCG, limited sensitivity in HIV+
- **Indications**: LTBI screening, mostly replaced by IGRA

### Step 5: Special Investigations for Extrapulmonary TB

#### Diagnostic Sampling
- **CSF**: For TB meningitis (lumbar puncture)
- **Pleural Fluid**: Thoracentesis for pleural TB
- **Ascitic Fluid**: Paracentesis for abdominal TB
- **Biopsy**: Tissue sampling (FNAC, excisional biopsy)

#### Imaging Studies
- **Ultrasound**: Guidance for fluid aspiration, assessment of lymph nodes
- **CT Scan**: Superior for mediastinal/hilar adenopathy
- **MRI**: Preferred for spinal TB, superior soft tissue resolution
- **PET-CT**: For complex cases, activity localization

## Diagnostic Algorithms

### WHO Recommendations for Microbiological Diagnosis

#### Algorithm A: For HIV-Negative Patients
1. Symptom screen positive → Collect sputum → CB-NAAT
2. If CB-NAAT negative → Smear microscopy
3. If smear negative → Chest X-ray, clinical assessment

#### Algorithm B: For HIV-Positive Patients
1. Symptoms suggest TB → CB-NAAT as first test
2. Low CD4 count (<100 cells/µL) → Start empirical treatment if CB-NAAT negative

#### Algorithm C: For Children
1. Symptom screen → Chest X-ray + stool/urine samples
2. If TB suspected → CB-NAAT testing
3. Invasive procedures if extrapulmonary TB considered

### National TB Programme (RNTCP) Guidelines
- **Universal DST**: First-line drugs tested for all detected TB cases
- **GENE XPERT Scale-Up**: Available at district level for early diagnosis
- **Notification System**: All cases reported through NIKSHAY portal

## Diagnosis in Special Populations

### Pediatric TB Diagnosis
- **Challenges**: Adequate sample collection difficult
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Often made without microbiological confirmation
- **Tests**: Gastric aspirates, stool specimens, nasopharyngeal swabs
- **Imaging**: CXR findings often subtle, lymphadenopathy common

### TB in People Living with HIV (PLHIV)
- **Lower Sensitivity**: Smear microscopy only 30-50% sensitive
- **Extrapulmonary Disease**: More common, pleural effusion most frequent
- **CB-NAAT Superior**: Better sensitivity than microscopy
- **CD4 Count Correlation**: Advanced immunosuppression → more disseminated disease

### Diagnosis in Pregnancy
- **Concerns**: Foetal radiation exposure from CXR
- **Safe Imaging**: Abdominal shielding, CXR only if absolutely needed
- **USG**: Safe investigation for suspected abdominal TB
- **Sampling**: Amniocentesis if congenital TB suspected

### Screening Programs
- **Active Case Finding**: Door-to-door surveys, contact tracing
- **Sector-Specific Screening**: Healthcare workers, miners, prisoners
- **High-Risk Groups**: Diabetics, tobacco users, migrants

## Interpretation of Results

### Negative Results
- **Rule Out TB**: High clinical suspicion requires further investigation
- **Alternative Diagnoses**: Consider lung cancer, pneumonia, HIV-related diseases
- **Repeat Testing**: Serial sputum samples improve sensitivity

### Discordant Results
- **Smear-Negative, Culture-Positive**: Represents early or paucibacillary disease
- **CBNAAT-Positive, Smear-Negative**: Indicates low bacterial load

### Drug Resistance Detection
- **First-Line Resistance**: CB-NAAT detects rifampicin resistance
- **MDR Confirmation**: Culture and DST required
- **Patient Implications**: Longer treatment duration, alternative regimens

## Key Points for Review

1. **Clinical Suspicion**: Four-symptom screen (cough >2w, fever, weight loss, night sweats)
2. **First-Line Test**: CB-NAAT/GeneXpert for rapid MTB detection and rifampicin resistance
3. **Smear Microscopy**: Conventional AFB staining, 45-65% sensitive
4. **Culture**: Gold standard, required for Drug susceptibility testing
5. **Diagnostic Cascade**: Symptoms → Imaging → Microbiological confirmation
6. **Special Populations**: HIV-PA, chemotherapy patients, children – require different approaches
7. **Algorithms**: WHO recommends different algorithms for HIV-positive and -negative individuals
