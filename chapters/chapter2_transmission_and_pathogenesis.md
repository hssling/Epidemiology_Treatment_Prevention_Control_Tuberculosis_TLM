## Transmission of Tuberculosis

TB transmission occurs primarily through airborne routes, making it highly contagious in certain settings. Understanding transmission dynamics is crucial for implementing effective infection control measures.

### Airborne Transmission Mechanism
**Source of Infection**: Individuals with active pulmonary TB who are sputum smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB).

**Transmission Routes**:
- **Droplet Nuclei**: Infectious particles 1-5 microns in diameter generated by:
  - Coughing (most common, 85% of transmission)
  - Sneezing
  - Speaking loudly or singing
  - Laughing or forced expiration

**Infectious Timeline**:
- Untreated smear-positive pulmonary TB patients remain infectious for 2-4 weeks
- Properly treated patients become non-infectious within 2 weeks
- Smear-negative patients rarely transmit infection

### Environmental Factors
**Droplet Nuclei Characteristics**:
- Can remain suspended in air for several hours
- Travel considerable distances (meters to kilometers)
- Settle slowly due to small size (1-5 microns)
- Penetrate deeply into alveoli of the lungs

**Settings with High Transmission Risk**:
- Crowded indoor spaces (households, prisons, dormitories)
- Poor ventilation and air circulation
- Close contact (<2 meters) for prolonged periods (>8 hours)
- Healthcare facilities without proper infection control

### Viral Load and Infectivity
- **Infectious Dose**: Very low (<10 bacteria) can cause infection
- **Bacterial Load**: Higher in cavitary disease than non-cavitary
- **Sputum Counts**: ≥5+ AFB highly infectious

### Risk of Infection Calculation
The risk depends on several factors:
- Concentration of infectious droplet nuclei in air
- Duration and proximity of exposure
- Virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain
- Susceptibility of the exposed host (age, comorbidities)

## Pathogenesis of Tuberculosis

Pathogenesis involves complex interplay between the bacterium, host immunity, and environmental factors. The process from infection to active disease development is influenced by multiple host and microbial factors.

### Primary TB Infection

#### 1. Inhalation and Deposition
- **Route**: Droplet nuclei reach terminal bronchioles and alveoli
- **Alveolar Exposure**: Particles 1-5 microns deposit in respiratory bronchioles and alveoli
- **Initial Bacterial Load**: Usually low (10-100 viable organisms)

#### 2. Early Interactions
- **Alveolar Macrophages**: Phagocytosis within hours
- **Bacillary Multiplication**: Begins in alveolar macrophages within 1-2 weeks
- **Inflammatory Response**: Recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes

#### 3. Primary Complex Formation
- **Ghon Focus**: Caseous necrosis in the infected lung segment
- **Hilar Lymph Nodes**: Enlargement and caseation in draining lymph nodes
- **Hematogenous Dissemination**: Bacteria enter bloodstream within 2-3 weeks

### Immune Response Development

#### Innate Immunity
- **Macrophage Response**: Phagocytosis, cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-6)
- **Neutrophil Influx**: Early inflammatory response
- **Toll-like Receptors**: Recognize mycobacterial antigens

#### Adaptive Immunity
- **T-Cell Activation**: CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes proliferate
- **IFN-γ Production**: Critical for macrophage activation
- **Granuloma Formation**: Organized immune response to contain bacteria
  - Epithelioid cells surround infected macrophages
  - Langhans giant cells form
  - Lymphocytes encircle the focus

### Latent TB Infection (LTBI)

#### Characteristics
- **Asymptomatic State**: No clinical symptoms or radiographic changes
- **Immunologic Control**: Host immune response is dominant
- **Bacillary Persistence**: 10-100 viable organisms persist in granulomas
- **No Transmission**: LTBI individuals do not transmit infection

#### Duration
- Can persist lifelong
- Progressive immunological control over years
- Risk of reactivation decreases over time

### Reactivation of TB

#### Triggering Factors
- **Host Immunodeficiency**: HIV/AIDS (20-30x increased risk)
- **Medical Conditions**: Organ transplant, autoimmune disease therapy
- **Age-related Decline**: Elderly have weaker cell-mediated immunity
- **Treatment with Immunomodulators**: TNF antagonists, corticosteroids

#### Reactivation Mechanism
- **Granuloma Breakdown**: Dormant bacteria replicate as immunity wanes
- **Caseation Liquefaction**: Necrotic material provides growth medium
- **Tissue Destruction**: Progressive cavitation and fibrosis

### Progressive Primary TB

#### Characteristics
- **Common in Immunocompromised**: Infants, HIV-infected, malnourished
- **Rapid Progression**: From infection to symptoms within weeks
- **Disseminated Disease**: Miliary TB or meningitis more likely
- **High Mortality**: Without prompt treatment

### Primary and Post-Primary TB Comparison

| Aspect | Primary TB | Post-Primary TB (Reactivation) |
|--------|------------|-------------------------------|
| Age | Children and young adults | Adults (20-50 years) |
| Location | Lower lobes/middles lobes | Upper lobes |
| Presentation | Mild or asymptomatic | Cavitary, destructive |
| Radiographic | Ghon complex | Apical cavities |
| Transmission | Less common | Highly infectious |

## Immunopathology in Active TB

### Tissue Destruction Processes

#### Granulomatous Inflammation
- **Caseation Necrosis**: Cheese-like appearance due to protease activity
- **Liquefaction**: Enzymatic breakdown of necrotic tissue
- **Cavitation**: Bronchial erosion creates cavities
- **Fibrosis**: Healing with scar tissue formation

#### Systemic Effects
- **Constitutional Symptoms**: Fever, weight loss, fatigue
- **Tissue Dissemination**: Via blood and lymphatics
- **Extrathoracic Involvement**: In 15% of cases

## Key Points for Review

1. **Transmission**: Airborne via droplet nuclei from cough/sneeze of infectious pulmonary TB patients
2. **Infectious Dose**: Very low, highly contagious in crowded settings
3. **Primary Infection**: Inhalation → alveolar deposition → macrophage phagocytosis → granuloma formation
4. **Latent TB**: Asymptomatic, bacteria contained in granulomas, no transmission
5. **Reactivation**: Occurs when immunity declines, leads to symptomatic disease
6. **Progressive Primary**: Rapid progression common in immunocompromised hosts
7. **Cavitation**: Key feature of active pulmonary TB, increases infectivity
