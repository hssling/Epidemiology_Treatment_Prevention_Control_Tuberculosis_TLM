## Introduction to TB Treatment

Successful tuberculosis treatment requires administering multiple antimycobacterial drugs for an adequate duration to achieve cure, prevent relapse, and minimize drug resistance development. Treatment must be patient-centered, individualized, and supported by comprehensive monitoring.

### Key Principles of Successful Treatment
- **Early Identification and Treatment**: Prompt initiation to reduce transmission
- **Combination Chemotherapy**: Multiple drugs to prevent resistance
- **Directly Observed Treatment (DOT)**: Supervised drug intake for adherence
- **Duration-Based Treatment**: Adequate time to eradicate bacilli
- **Tailored to Drug Resistance**: Shorter regimens for susceptible, longer for resistant

## Treatment of Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis (DS-TB)

Most TB cases (>90%) in India are drug-susceptible, responding to first-line regimens.

### Standard First-Line Regimen

#### Intensive Phase (2 months)
- **Regimen**: Prednisone H, Rifampicin R, Pyrazinamide Z, Ethambutol E (2HRZE)
- **Dosing**:
  - H: 5mg/kg (maximum 300mg)
  - R: 10mg/kg (maximum 600mg)
  - Z: 25mg/kg (maximum 2g)
  - E: 15mg/kg (maximum 1.6g)
- **Daily Dosing**: All medications taken together once daily

#### Continuation Phase (4 months)
- **Regimen**: 4HR
- **Dosing**: Continue H and R at same doses
- **Frequency**: 5 days/week (thrice weekly) option in DOT programs
- **Total Duration**: 6 months

### Response Monitoring
- **Clinical**: Fever subsides (1-2 weeks), weight gain, cough reduction
- **Microbiological**: Sputum conversion (negative by 2 months)
- **Radiological**: X-ray improvement (by 2-3 months)

### Early Treatment Outcomes
- **Treatment Success Rate**: >85% in India
- **Sputum Conversion Rate**: 80-90% by end of intensive phase
- **Relapse Rate**: <5% with complete treatment

### Shorter Regimens for Eligible Patients

- **Culture**: Monthly until negative

### Clinical Monitoring
- **Weight Measurement**: Monthly, target gain >2kg/month
- **Symptoms Review**: Cough, fever, side effects
- **X-ray**: End of intensive phase, end of treatment

### Treatment Outcomes
- **Cured**: Completed treatment with negative follow-up cultures
- **Completed**: Finished treatment but no follow-up cultures
- **Failed**: Positive cultures in 5th month or later
- **Died**: Died during treatment period
- **Lost to Follow-Up**: Treatment interruption >2 consecutive months
