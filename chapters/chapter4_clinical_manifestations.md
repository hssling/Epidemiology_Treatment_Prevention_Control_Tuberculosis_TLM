## Introduction to TB Clinical Features

Tuberculosis presents with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic latent infection to severe disseminated disease. Recognition of symptoms is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment initiation.

### Classification of Disease
- **Pulmonary TB**: Involves lungs (85% of cases)
- **Extrapulmonary TB**: Other organ involvement (15% of cases)
- **Disseminated/Miliary TB**: Widespread disease involving multiple organs

---

## Constitutional Symptoms (Systemic Manifestations)

Common to most forms of active TB, these symptoms reflect the systemic inflammatory response.

### Fever
- **Pattern**: Low-grade fever (subfebrile), typically evening rise
- **Duration**: Persists for weeks to months
- **Mechanism**: Endogenous pyrogens from monocytes and macrophages
- **Associated Signs**: May be associated with chills or rigors

### Night Sweats
- **Incidence**: Present in 70-80% of active TB cases
- **Mechanism**: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) mediated
- **Clinical Significance**: Often distressing and debilitating
- **Severity**: Can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance

### Weight Loss
- **Incidence**: 50-70% of patients experience significant weight loss
- **Mechanism**: Increased metabolic rate, reduced appetite, malabsorption
- **Thresholds**: Unintended weight loss >5% of body weight concerning
- **Severity**: Cachexia develops in advanced cases

### Fatigue and Weakness
- **Mechanism**: Chronic inflammation, anemia from nutritional deficiency
- **Impact**: Significantly impairs quality of life and daily activities
- **Assessment**: Measured using fatigue severity scores

### Anorexia
- **Incidence**: Present in majority of active TB cases
- **Mechanisms**: Elevated cytokine levels (leptin, ghrelin imbalance)
- **Consequences**: Further contributes to malnutrition and weight loss

### Other Constitutional Signs
- **Pallor**: Secondary to anemia
- **Clubbing**: Rare, occurs in advanced pulmonary TB
- **Lymphadenopathy**: Generalized in disseminated TB

## Pulmonary Tuberculosis Manifestations

Pulmonary TB accounts for the majority of TB cases and is responsible for transmission to others.

### Respiratory Symptoms

#### Cough
- **Characteristic**: Persistent cough >2 weeks (key diagnostic feature)
- **Progression**: Initially dry, then becomes productive with sputum
- **Hemoptysis**: Blood-streaked sputum in 20-30% of cases
- **Cause**: Inflammation and bronchial irritation

#### Chest Pain
- **Pleural Pain**: Sharp, pleuritic pain during coughing/inspiration
- **Mechanism**: Inflammation of pleura or chest wall
- **Parenchymal Pain**: Dull pain in advanced cavitation

#### Dyspnea
- **Severity**: Varies from mild exertion-related to severe respiratory failure
- **Mechanisms**: Airway obstruction, pleural effusion, or extensive fibrosis
- **Predictive Value**: Suggests advanced disease or complications

### Physical Examination Findings

#### Vital Signs
- **Fever**: Low-grade temperature elevation
- **Respiratory Rate**: Increased in advanced disease
- **Pulse Rate**: Tachycardia common

#### Pulmonary Examination
- **Auscultation**: Crackles, bronchial breathing, or pleural rub
- **Percussion**: Dullness over consolidation or effusion
- **Palpation**: Reduced chest expansion in severe disease

### Radiographic Features
- **Normal CXR**: 5-10% of sputum-positive TB cases
- **Classic Findings**: Upper lobe opacities, cavity formation
- **Infiltrates**: Alveolar, nodular, or miliary patterns
- **Associated Findings**: Hilar adenopathy, pleural effusion

## Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis Manifestations

Extrathoracic TB involves organs other than lungs and presents with organ-specific symptoms.

### Lymph Node TB (Tuberculous Lymphadenitis)
- **Site**: Cervical glands most common (scrofula in children)
- **Presentation**: Painless, enlarged nodes, may become fluctuant
- **Complications**: Sinus formation with discharge
- **Diagnosis**: Excisional biopsy shows caseating granulomas

### Pleural TB
- **Primary Pleuritis**: Caused by direct bacterial invasion
- **Associated with PTB**: Often presents with underlying parenchymal TB
- **Symptoms**: Pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, fever
- **Management**: Pleural drainage, systemic anti-TB therapy

### Genitourinary TB
- **Urinary TB**: Dysuria, frequency, flank pain
- **Sterile Pyuria**: WBC in urine without bacterial growth
- **Specific Symptoms**: Females - vaginal discharge, infertility; Males - epididymal swelling
- **Late Complications**: Renal scarring, bladder Contracture

### Skeletal TB (TB Osteomyelitis)
- **Spine TB (Pott's Disease)**: Most common form, vertebral involvement
- **Presentation**: Chronic back pain, kyphosis (gibbus deformity)
- **Extremities**: Swelling, discharge, limb deformities
- **Diagnosis**: MRI superior, shows vertebral destruction and cold abscesses

### Meningeal TB (TB Meningitis)
- **Presentation**: Subacute headache, fever, altered mentation
- **CSF Findings**: Lymphocytic pleocytosis, low glucose, high protein
- **Staging**: Stage I (prodromal), II (meningeal signs), III (comatose)
- **Neurological Sequelae**: Hydrocephalus, cranial nerve palsies, stroke

### Gastrointestinal TB
- **Ileocecal TB**: Most common abdominal TB
- **Presentation**: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss
- **Complications**: Gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, fistula formation
- **Diagnosis**: Laparoscopic biopsy for histological confirmation

### Other Sites
- **Pericardial TB**: Tamponade, constriction
- **Cutaneous TB**: Various forms (lupus vulgaris, scrofuloderma)
- **Ophthalmic TB**: Choroiditis, panophthalmia
- **Laryngeal TB**: Hoarseness, chronic cough

---

## Disseminated (Miliary) Tuberculosis

Widespread hematogenous spread affecting multiple organs.

### Clinical Features
- **Onset**: Insidious, constitutional symptoms prominent
- **Systemic Signs**: Fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly
- **Multiple Organ Involvement**: Lungs, liver, bone marrow, meninges
- **Radiographic Pattern**: Fine millet-seed like lesions on CXR

### Risk Groups
- **Children**: Progressive primary TB often miliary
- **HIV Patients**: Impaired granuloma formation
- **Immunosuppressed**: Similar pathogenesis

---

## TB in Special Populations

### Pediatric TB
- **Epidemiology**: ~1.2 million children develop TB annually
- **Clinical Features**: More likely extrapulmonary (30-50% vs 15% in adults)
- **Diagnostic Challenges**: Difficult sputum collection, anatomical differences
- **Forms**: Primary complex, hilar adenopathy, miliary disease

### TB in Pregnancy
- **Risk**: TB increases maternal/fetal mortality
- **Presentation**: Similar to non-pregnant, but pregnancy symptoms may mask TB
- **Diagnosis**: CXR safe (fetal dose minimal), obstetric ultrasound for staging
- **Treatment**: Streptomycin avoided due to embryotoxicity

### TB-HIV Co-infection
- **Manifestations**: Atypical presentations, extrapulmonary common
- **Progression**: Faster disease development and spread
- **Immune Reconstitution**: IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome)
- **Treatment**: ART initiation timing critical (2-8 weeks post ATT)

---

## Complications of TB

Severe consequences that significantly impact prognosis and treatment.

### Pulmonary Complications
- **Bronchiectasis**: Irreversible bronchial dilatation
- **Respiratory Failure**: Refractory hypoxemia, ARDS
- **Hemoptysis**: Massive bleeding requiring intervention
- **Pneumothorax**: Spontaneous or iatrogenic

### Systemic Complications
- **Drug-Induced Hepatitis**: Isoniazid most hepatotoxic
- **Peripheral Neuropathy**: Pyridoxine deficiency (INH)
- **Drug Interactions**: Antiretroviral interactions in HIV-TB
- **Chronic Lung Disease**: Fibrotic changes post-treatment

### Prognosis Indicators
- **Poor Prognostic Factors**: Advanced age, comorbidities, drug resistance
- **Good Response**: Symptom resolution within 2 weeks, sputum conversion
- **Monitoring**: Serial sputum smears, clinical parameters, weight gain

## Key Points for Review

1. **Constitutional Symptoms**: Fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue (B-symptoms)
2. **Pulmonary TB**: Chronic cough >2 weeks, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea
3. **Extrapulmonary Sites**: Lymph nodes, pleura, GU tract, bones, meninges, GI tract
4. **Diagnostic Key**: Persistent cough >2 weeks with systemic symptoms suggests TB
5. **Active vs Latent**: Latent asymptomatic, active has clinical manifestations
6. **Special Groups**: Children - extrapulmonary, HIV - atypical, pregnant - mask symptoms
7. **Complications**: Hepatitis, neuropathy, bronchiectasis, respiratory failure
