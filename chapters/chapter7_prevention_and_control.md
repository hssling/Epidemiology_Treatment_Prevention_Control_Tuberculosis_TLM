## Introduction to TB Prevention and Control

Tuberculosis prevention and control encompass a comprehensive approach involving vaccination, risk factor reduction, early detection, treatment, and infection control. The three-tier prevention strategy addresses different levels of intervention to interrupt transmission and reduce disease burden.

### Levels of Prevention
- **Primary Prevention**: Preventing disease occurrence before infection
- **Secondary Prevention**: Early detection and treatment to prevent progression
- **Tertiary Prevention**: Managing complications and preventing further transmission

---

## Primary Prevention

Primary prevention aims to prevent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection through vaccination and risk factor modification.

### BCG Vaccination

#### Overview
- **Type**: Live attenuated vaccine derived from Mycobacterium bovis
- **Administration**: Intradermal injection at birth
- **Coverage in India**: >95% through EPI program

#### Efficacy
- **Childhood Protection**: 60-80% protection against severe forms (miliary TB, TB meningitis)
- **Adult Efficacy**: Variable, usually <50% against pulmonary TB
- **Duration**: Protection lasts ~10-15 years in children

#### Indications and Contraindications
- **Routine**: All newborns in high-burden countries
- **Special**: HIV-negative individuals, healthcare workers exposed to MDR-TB
- **Contraindicated**: Severe immunodeficiency (SCID), symptomatic HIV, active TB, keloid scar formation

#### Adverse Events
- **Local Reactions**: Ulceration, regional lymphadenitis (suppurative)
- **Severe**: Disseminated BCG infection in immunocompromised hosts
- **Management**: Spontaneous healing, surgical drainage if needed

### Chemoprophylaxis for Latent TB Infection
- **Indication**: High-risk individuals without active TB
- **Regimens**: See Chapter 6 (TPT section)
- **Effectiveness**: Reduces progression to active TB by 60-90%

### Risk Factor Modification

#### HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment
- **ART Coverage**: Prevents immune suppression that predisposes to TB
- **Prophylaxis**: Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for PLHIV
- **Coverage**: TB screening for all PLHIV

#### Diabetes Mellitus Control
- **Screening**: Annual TB screening for diabetics
- **Management**: Good glycemic control reduces TB risk
- **TPT**: Consider latent TB treatment in diabetics

#### Tobacco and Alcohol Control
- **Smoking Cessation**: Reduces TB risk by 50% within 1-2 years
- **Programs**: Counseling, nicotine replacement therapy
- **Alcoholism Treatment**: Integrated management with psychopathy services

#### Nutritional Improvement
- **Vitamin D Supplementation**: Beneficial for TB prevention
- **Micronutrient Programs**: Regular vitamin supplementation in malnutrition-prone areas
- **Social Support**: Food security programs and poverty alleviation

## Secondary Prevention

Secondary prevention focuses on early detection and prompt treatment to break the chain of transmission.

### Active Case Finding (ACF)
- **Target Groups**: Household contacts, high-risk populations
- **Methods**: Symptom screening, mass X-ray campaigns
- **Settings**: Prisons, migrant worker camps, urban slums

### Contact Tracing
- **.household Contacts**: Screening of all household members
- **High-Risk Contacts**: Children <5 years, immunocompromised adults
- **Recent Infectors**: TST/IGRA testing and TPT if indicated
- **Monitoring**: 24-month follow-up for symptom development

### Screening Programs
- **WHO Target**: 90% of high-risk groups screened annually
- **Digital Solutions**: AI-assisted chest X-ray reading
- **Mobile Vans**: Access to peripheral areas
