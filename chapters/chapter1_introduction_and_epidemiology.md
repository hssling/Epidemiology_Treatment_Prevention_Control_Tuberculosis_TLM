## Introduction to Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacteria. It primarily affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can involve other organs (extrapulmonary TB). TB is preventable and curable but remains a major global health challenge.

### Key Facts
- Caused by acid-fast bacilli (AFB)
- Bacterial genus: Mycobacterium
- Primarily airborne transmission
- Affects approximately 10 million people globally each year (2023 estimates)
- Leading infectious killer after COVID-19, surpassing HIV/AIDS

### Historical Context
- Ancient disease known as "consumption"
- Discovered as infectious in 1882 by Robert Koch
- Major pandemics in 19th-20th centuries

## Epidemiology

### Global Burden of Tuberculosis
- **Incidence**: 10.6 million new TB cases annually (WHO 2023)
- **Prevalence**: 11.4 million people living with TB
- **Deaths**: 1.3 million TB-related deaths per year (excluding HIV-TB)
- **Status**: Leading cause of death from a single infectious agent (2021-2023 period)
- **Endemic in**: Most countries worldwide
- **Contribution to AMR**: Major driver of antimicrobial resistance globally

### Regional Distribution
TB is concentrated in 30 high-burden countries, accounting for over 87% of global cases:
- **Highest Burden Countries** (2023):
  - South Africa (~260,000 cases)
  - Indonesia (~590,000 cases)
  - Bangladesh (~350,000 cases)
  - Nigeria (~460,000 cases)
  - India (~2.8 million cases)
  - China (~750,000 cases)
  - Philippines (~580,000 cases)
  - Pakistan (~570,000 cases)

### Socioeconomic Impact
- **Economic Burden**: TB costs affected countries ~$10 billion annually
- **Productivity Loss**: Patients lose 20-30% of annual income
- **Social Consequences**: Stigma, discrimination, isolation

## India Statistics

India bears the highest TB burden globally and accounts for approximately 27% of the world's TB cases.

### Current Estimates (2023)
- **Annual Incidence**: 2.8 million new cases (incidence rate: 210 per 100,000 population)
- **Prevalence**: 2.1 million people living with TB
- **Mortality**: ~3.2 lakh deaths annually (including HIV-TB)
- **Drug-Resistant TB**: ~1.4 lakh MDR-TB cases

### Regional Variations
- **High-Burden States**: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan
- **Tribal Areas**: Higher prevalence in scheduled tribes (2-3 times higher than national average)
- **Urban vs Rural**: Higher burden in urban slums due to overcrowding and poor living conditions

### India's Share in Global TB
- One-fourth of global TB epidemic
- Accounts for quarter of global TB mortality
- Third-largest contributor to TB deaths after Indonesia and Myanmar

## Latent TB Infection (LTBI)

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) represents a significant portion of TB epidemiology and is crucial for understanding disease control.

### Definition and Prevalence
- **Definition**: Asymptomatic infection where bacteria are contained by host immunity
- **Global Prevalence**: About 1.7 billion people (23% of world population) have LTBI
- **India Estimates**: ~400-500 million people have LTBI

### Life Course of LTBI
- **Infection Rate**: 5-15% lifetime risk of progressing to active TB among infected individuals
- **Progression Risk Factors**:
  - Immunosuppression (HIV, organ transplant)
  - Age (young children, elderly)
  - Medical conditions (diabetes, renal failure)
  - Social factors (poverty, homelessness)

### Public Health Implications
- LTBI is not contagious
- Treatment of LTBI (Preventive Therapy) prevents progression to active disease
- Mass screening programs target high-risk groups for LTBI

## Key Points for Review

1. **TB Pathogen**: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, acid-fast bacillus
2. **Transmission**: Primarily airborne, infects lungs first
3. **Global Impact**: 10.6 million cases, 1.3 million deaths annually
4. **India's Burden**: Highest globally, 2.8 million cases per year
5. **Latent TB**: 1.7 billion infected worldwide, can activate under immunosuppression
6. **Prevention**: Feasible through immunization, risk factor control, and LTBI treatment
