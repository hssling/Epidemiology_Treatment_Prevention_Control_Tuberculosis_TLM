## Introduction to NTEP

The National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) aims to reduce TB incidence from 210 per 1 lakh per year to less than 1 per 1 lakh per year by 2025, making India TB-free by 2030. This ambitious target requires comprehensive approaches across prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance.

### Evolution of NTEP
- **1962-1992**: NTP Phase I - Sanatorium approach, poor outcomes
- **1992-1997**: RNTCP pilot with DOTS strategy
- **1997-2017**: RNTCP expansion, >80% coverage by 2011
- **2020-Present**: NTEP phase with elimination targets

### Program Structure
- **Leadership**: Central TB Division (CTD), Ministry of H&FW
- **Implementation**: Through 733 districts across 36 states
- **Budget**: ₹12,000 crores allocated (2023-2027)
- **Achievements**: Notified 24 lakh cases in 2022, treatment success 84%
